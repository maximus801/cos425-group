I spent most of my winter break inside working on programming projects. One in particular monitors the power used by my clothes washer and reports to a remote monitor. The monitor is an M5Core device about 2"x2".1" that has WiFi, a display, some buttons and a speaker in addition to 12 RGB LEDs. When the wash is running it displays the power use and green LED's circle around the device. When the wash is complete, it plays an MP3 file and turns red. Mostly it was a bit of work to remind me when the wash is done. And I had fun!

Over winter break I spent most of my time working. I work part time serving and bartending at a local restaurant. Not having any classes to attend gave me the opportunity to work more. Unfortunately I was not able to travel home and spend Christmas with my family. I ended up working on Christmas day and New Years day as well. I know this sounds pretty uneventful but I was able to make some extra money!

Most of my winter break was spent at the dorms, resting up and preparing for the following semester. My roommate has an Emotional Support Animal (esa) so I had to contend with her quite a bit over break alongside my roommate. At one point I took part in a (not so) secret santa gift exchange with some friends through discord across the US. I got a nice blanket out of it, which was nice since the dorms are quite cold over break. Overall, I had fun.

I spent most of my winter break doing very little. I caught a case of covid right before Christmas so I spent most of the holidays inside finding ways to entertain myself. I learned how to sew and made a shirt, did several puzzles, and cooked a wide variety of dishes. When I wasn't sick I went on several hikes and foolishly attempted to make a gym resolution for the new year.

Over the winter break, my partner and I travelled to New Jersey to spend Christmas with her family. When we got back, we spent a majority of our time at home because of Covid. However, we spent some time seeing my many nieces and nephews, and enjoyed our break with some homebody activities. I played a lot of video games, particularly Red Dead Redemption 2, Valorant, and Enderal. Additionally, I purchased a Raspberry Pi Pico and I have been toying around with wiring and programming that.

I spent most of my time at home during the winter break. I watched a British baking show, and it made me want to learn baking. I practiced baking some fun stuff, like macarons and cream puffs, and they came out good. Also, I purchased the entire series of Demon Slayer books and enjoyed reading them. They were expensive, but I thought they were worth buying.

## Cooper Duncan
I spent the majority of the winter break relaxing in preparation for the spring semester. I spent alot of my time playing games with friends and hanging out with my girlfriend. My brother decided to move out and got his own place so I helped him with all the moving. Other than that, I just tried to enjoy the break the best I could.
